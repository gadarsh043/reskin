# Slop test — 38 gates

Run this list before handing back any output. Every answer must be **no**. Update the Step 5 preview block's `Slop test` row to reflect the actual outcome of this run.

Some gates are **universal** (apply to every genre); some are **genre-scoped** (apply only when the active genre is editorial, atmospheric, modern-minimal, or playful). Genre overrides are noted inline. Where a gate has *no* genre note, treat it as universal.

---

## Visual

1. Is the display font Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Poppins, Lato, or a system default?
2. Is there a purple-to-blue (or cyan-to-magenta) gradient anywhere? *Genre note: atmospheric allows radial gradients on background only — never on text or pill buttons.*
3. Is there a 3-equal-column card grid with icon-above-heading tiles?
4. Is any card nested inside another card?
5. Is there a `background-clip: text` gradient headline? (Universal — no genre allows gradient text.)
6. Is any card using a thick coloured left/right side-stripe border?
7. Is the hero `min-height: 100vh` with everything centred? *Genre note: atmospheric and playful allow centred heroes when the canvas itself is the design (Suno-style).*
8. Is pure `#000` or pure `#fff` used as a base colour anywhere? *Genre note: modern-minimal allows pure `#fff` paper (the Stripe / ElevenLabs school).*

## Structural

9. Does the page use the *same* structural fingerprint as the last page you built? (Hero → 3 features → CTA → footer is the AI structural template; reject it.)
10. Are sections separated only by equal whitespace, with no rule, no ornament, no colour shift — every section identical in rhythm?

## Microinteractions

11. Is `transition-all` (or `transition: all`) used anywhere? (Specify the properties.)
12. Is `hover:scale-105` (or any uniform hover-scale) applied across multiple unrelated elements?
13. Are bouncy / overshoot easings (`cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, ...)`, etc.) used on UI state changes — buttons, modals, tooltips? (Reserve overshoots for physical interactions only.)
14. Does any element have *more than one* hover effect at the same time (translate + scale + shadow + colour + rotate)?
15. Are you animating `width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, `margin`, or `padding` anywhere?
16. Does the focus ring transition into existence (fade in)? (Focus rings must appear instantly — keyboard users need an immediate indicator.)
17. Is there a celebratory success toast for an action whose effect the user can already see? (Silent success is taste; toasts are for failures and invisible effects.)
18. Are tooltip hover-delay and focus-delay equal? (Hover should delay 800–1000 ms; focus should be 0 ms.)
19. Is auto-rotating content (carousel, banner, stats) lacking pause-on-hover-and-focus? (WCAG 2.2.2.)
20. Is there a placeholder name "Jane Doe / John Smith" or a startup cliché (Acme, Nexus, Seamless, Unleash)?

## Variety

21. Is the `/* Hallmark · macrostructure: <name> · ... */` stamp missing from the top of the CSS? (It must be present.)
22. Is the macrostructure I picked the same as a previous Hallmark output's stamp in this project? (Read the file system; if a stamp exists, mine must differ.)
23. Did I default to the **Specimen** macrostructure (numbered left-margin labels + huge serif + asymmetric spans + typographic-only CTA) when the brief did not explicitly call for editorial / foundry / specimen energy? (Specimen fall-through is banned.) *Genre note: atmospheric, modern-minimal, and playful never default to Specimen — only editorial does, and only when the brief signals it.*

## Implementation gates

24. Does any neutral / surface colour have `oklch(... 0 ...)` (zero chroma)? Pure greys read as flat. Tint every neutral toward the anchor hue — minimum 0.005 chroma. *Genre note: modern-minimal allows zero-chroma neutrals (the monochrome Stripe / ElevenLabs school).*
25. Does the accent colour cover more than ~5 % of any single viewport (count by area: solid fills, large headings in accent, full-bleed accent backgrounds)? If yes, retreat — accent is for emphasis, not for filling. *Genre note: atmospheric allows accent-tinted radial blooms covering up to ~20 % of the canvas, since the bloom is the design.*
26. Is any padding / gap / margin a value that isn't on the named spacing scale (`--space-3xs` … `--space-5xl`, multiples of 4 px)? Arbitrary `padding: 17px` is a tell.
27. Is any prose container's `max-width` outside the 45–75 ch range? Measure must read; under 45 ch is choppy, over 75 ch loses the eye.
28. Does any interactive element lack `:focus-visible`, `:active`, OR `:disabled` styling? (Eight states is the rule. Default + hover is two; you need at least default + hover + focus-visible + active + disabled present in code.)
29. Is there any `transform` / `animation` keyframe that is NOT covered by a `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` fallback? Every motion gets a reduced-motion alternative.

## Hero enrichment gates

(When the page carries enrichment — see [`hero-enrichment.md`](hero-enrichment.md).)

30. If the page has a demo video, does it autoplay with sound, lack a `poster`, lack `fetchpriority="high"`, or use `loading="lazy"` on the LCP element? (LCP-killers fail this gate.)
31. If the page has an abstract background, is it more than one accent colour, more than ~5 % footprint, or animating mesh-gradient on the whole page? (Aurora blobs and mesh-on-everything fail this gate.) *Genre note: atmospheric allows up to two warm-toned radial blooms covering ~20–30 % of the canvas, fixed-attached, no animation.*
32. Does the page mix two or more icon libraries? (Material + Heroicons + Lucide on the same page = the icon-set tell.)
33. If the page has illustration, did I default to a Lottie library when a hand-built SVG or pure-CSS shape would have worked? (Lottie is last resort, not the default.)

## Diversification gates

(Cross-reference `.hallmark/log.json` when present.)

34. If I used the same archetype as a previous Hallmark output (per `.hallmark/log.json` or the latest macrostructure stamp), did I pick at least one different *variation knob*? Two Bento Grids with `tiles=6, spans=irregular, accent=corner-only` are the same Bento — the within-archetype knobs in [`component-cookbook.md`](component-cookbook.md) exist precisely to prevent that. State the knob deltas in the stamp.
35. Does any visual-only `<svg>`, custom-art `<div>`, `<canvas>`, or decorative figure lack `aria-label` or `aria-hidden="true"`? Hand-built CSS art and SVG illustrations need an accessible name *or* an explicit hide. Skipping this is the new accessibility tell.

## Layout-safety gates

(The page must survive every viewport.)

36. Does the page horizontally scroll on any viewport between 320 px and 1920 px? Open the rendered page; drag the dev-tools width slider across that range. If a horizontal scrollbar appears at any width, fail. The fix is `html { overflow-x: clip; }` plus `body { overflow-x: clip; }` as a safety net for any clipped-edge enrichment that pushes past the viewport. Use `overflow-x: clip` (not `hidden`) — `clip` preserves `position: sticky` and `position: fixed` on descendants. (Cross-reference: [`layout-and-space.md` § Page-edge clipping](layout-and-space.md).)
37. For every decorative effect on text — highlighter `<mark>` / `<em>` band / accent stroke / underline — did I visually confirm the position and size? A highlighter band must sit behind the x-height (`linear-gradient(180deg, transparent ~38%, accent ~38%, accent ~92%, transparent ~92%)`), **not** at the baseline (which reads as a fat underline). Underlines must be 1–2 px and offset 1–2 px from the baseline, never 5+ px. Decorative strokes must not exceed 5 % of the viewport (gate 25). The check is *visual*: imagine the rendered output and confirm the band lands in the right vertical zone.
38. Are interactive bars (nav, toolbar, command bar, hero CTA row, footer link strip) explicitly vertically centered? Default flex layouts inherit `align-items: stretch`, which makes a button taller than its sibling text and breaks the visual baseline. Every flex row mixing height-different elements (button + text, icon + text, mark + body) must declare `align-items: center` and `line-height: 1` on the items with intrinsic height. Inheriting `line-height: 1.55` from `html` fights the row's vertical rhythm.

If any answer is **yes**, fix it. Do not ship slop.
